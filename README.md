## What is MASH-FRET?
MASH-FRET is a GUI-based software package mainly written in **Matlab** for the analysis of **single-molecule FRET trajectories**. The framework encompasses the entire workflow from spot detection and trace processing to histogram and dwell time analysis. The program is structured in five modules:
- Simulation
- Movie Processing
- Trace Processing
- Histogram Analysis
- Transition Analysis

Inputs for analysis can be generated from simulations or single-molecule experiments.

## Getting started

Clone or download MASH-FRET into a directory of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/RNA-FRETools/MASH-FRET.git
```
Within Matlab, add MASH-FRET to your path by going to `Home → Set Path → Add with Subfolders`

**Note:** ***MASH-FRET 1.3.1** and above are tested to run under Matlab version R2020b on Windows 8.1 and Linux-Unbuntu 20.04. Earlier releases were tested under Matlab 2016a on Windows 8.1*

## Documentation

For information about the different modules of MASH-FRET and step-by-step tutorials please visit https://rna-fretools.github.io/MASH-FRET/. The documentation is under continuous development. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at rnafretools@chem.uzh.ch.

## Getting involved

MASH-FRET was developed by Mélodie Hadzic and Danny Kowerko in the group of Prof. Roland Sigel at the University of Zurich and is currently maintained by Fabio Steffen and Richard Börner.

Please report any **bugs** or **feature requests** through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RNA-FRETools/MASH-FRET/issues) on Github.
