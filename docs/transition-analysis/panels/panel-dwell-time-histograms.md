# Dwell time histograms
{: .no_toc }

Dwell time histograms is the third panel of module Transition analysis.

Use this panel to fit dwell time histograms with exponential functions and estimate state dgeneracy, transition rate coefficients (homogenous kinetics only) and associated cross-sample variability with BOBA-FRET.

## Dwell time processing

Use this panel to process state sequences prior building histograms.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-dt-processing.png" style="max-width:164px;">

It is possible to unite multiple states obained in panel 
[State configuration](panel-state-configuration.html) that have similar values by binning state values.  
&#8618; To unite states, enter a bin size in **(a)** greater than the largest value gap.

The first and last dwell times in state trajectories are not reliable as they are truncated by the limited observation time.
This experimental bias can be corrected by ignoring these particular dwell times in later analyses.  
&#8618; To exclude the first and last dwell times of each sequence, activate the option **(b)**.

In order to obtain dwell time histograms in line with clustered data, state sequences can be processed according to clustering results.
In this case, state transitions that are not included in any cluster ([clustering methods](panel-state-configuration.html#method-settings) `k-means` or `simple`), or that are included in diagonal clusters, are ignored and the dwell time prior transition is elongated.  
&#8618; To recalculate dwell times according to clustering results, activate the option **(c)**.

***Note:** The processed set of state sequences are used in panels [State lifetimes](panel-state-lifetimes.html) and [Kinetic model](panel-kinetic-model.html).*

## Fit settings

Press 
![Fit settings](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-fit-settings.png "Fit settings") to open fit options and set the fitting model and parameters, or to look at fitting results.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-fit-param.png" style="max-width:309px;">

As described in Transition analysis
[Workflow](../workflow.html#via-exponential-fit), fitting the cumulative dwell time histogram allows to:
- determine the state **transition rate coefficients in an homogenous system** (no degenerated state) from single exponential fit
- estimate **state degeneracy** via fitting a mixture of exponential functions or a single stretched exponential function

Fit settings are specific to each state value listed in **(a)**.

The fitting model can be automatically determined by performing successive exponential fits with an increasing number of components (3 max.) and stopping when bootstrap error ranges (3&sigma;) of time constants overlap.  
&#8618; To automatically determine model complexity and perform the fit, activates the option **(b)**. To set the fitting model manually, activate the option **(c)**.

### Manual settings
{: .no_toc }

Dwell time histograms can be fitted with two types of exponential functions:

- a **mixture of exponential** functions, by activating the option in **(e)** and set the number of components in **(f)**
- a **stretched exponential** function, by activating the option in **(d)**

Additionally, the cross-sample variability associated with rate coefficients can be estimated with BOBA-FRET by activating the option in **(g)**.
In that case, the number of replicates used to build a bootstrap histogram sample must be set in **(i)** and the number of bootstrap samples in **(j)**.
By default, the number of replicates is set to the number of molecules included in the selected transition cluster.

In order to not over-represent short trajectories in the bootstrap histograms, replicates can be given a weight proportional to the length of the associated state trajectory.
This is done by activating the option in **(h)**.

Parameters 
[*a<sub>j</sub><sup>d</sup>*](){: .math_var },
[*&tau;<sub>j</sub><sup>d</sup>*](){: .math_var } and 
[*&#946;<sub>j</sub>*](){: .math_var } as described in detail in Transition analysis
[Workflow](../workflow.html#via-exponential-fit) are respectively set in rows **(l)**, **(m)** and **(n)**, with the staring guess in column **(o)**, the lower bound in column **(p)** and higher bound in column **(q)**.

Once the fit is completed, fit parameters of the function selected in list **(k)** are displayed in column **(r)**.
When using BOBA-FRET, the bootstrap mean and standard deviation of fitting parameters are respectively displayed in column **(r)** and **(s)**.

## Start fit

Press 
![Fit current](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-fit-current.png "Fit current") to fit the currently displayed dwell time histogram with the fitting method defined in 
[Fit settings](#fit-settings).

Press 
![Fit all](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-fit-all.png "Fit all") to fit all dwell time histograms.

In the case where 
[Fit settings](#fit-settings) include BOBA-FRET and the number of replicates is different from the number of trajectories involving the current state, the number of replicates can be corrected prior performing histogram bootstrapping and exponential fit.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-replicates.png" style="max-width:493px;">

After completion, best fit parameters are shown in 
[Fit settings](#fit-settings) and state lifetimes together with relative contributions to the dwell time histogram are shown in 
[State lifetimes](#state-lifetimes).

## State lifetimes

Shows state lifetimes and relative contributions calculated from fit parameters.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-lifetimes.png" style="max-width:152px;">

States are defined by two indexes: 
- [*j*](){: .math_var } for the observed state value
- [*d*](){: .math_var } for the degenerate level 

The lifetime 
[*&tau;<sub>j</sub><sup>d</sup>*](){: .math_var } of each degenerated state 
[*d*](){: .math_var } listed in **(b)** with the observed state value 
[*j*](){: .math_var } listed in **(a)**
is shown in **(d)** .
When using BOBA-FRET, the bootstrap mean and standard deviation are respectively shown in **(d)** and **(e)**.

In the case of an homogeneous system (no state degeneracy), the transition rate coefficients 
[*k*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } can be calculated as the inverse of the state lifetime
[*&tau;*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } weighted by the associated number of transitions, such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TA-kin-ana-04.gif" alt="k_{j,j'} = \frac{w_{j,j'}}{\sum_{k \neq j}^{J} w_{j,k}} \times \frac{1}{\tau_{j,j'}}">

Where 
[*w*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } is the cluster population for transition 
[*j*](){: .math_var } to 
[*j'*](){: .math_var }. Cluster populations are available in the 
[Transition density cluster file](../../output-files/clst-transition-density-clusters.html).

The relative contribution 
[*&alpha;*](){: .math_var } of the degenerate state selected in **(b)** to the dwell time set characterized by the state values selected in **(a)** (before transition) and **(c)** (after transition), is shown in **(f)**.
It is calculated from exponential amplitudes such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TA-kin-ana-05.gif" alt="\alpha_{j,j'}^d = \frac{a_{j,j'}^d}{\sum_{k=1}^{D}a_{j,j'}^k}">

## Visualization area

Use this interface to visualize the cumulative dwell time histogram and fitting results.

The histogram plot depends on the 
[Fit settings](#fit-settings) and the stage the transition analysis is at.

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.


### Default
{: .no_toc }

Just after clustering and providing that the dwell time set selected in the
[State lifetimes](#state-lifetimes) is not empty, the corresponding cumulative and complementary dwell time histogram is plotted with blue solid markers.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-plot-default.png" style="max-width:216px;">

To identify potential multiple decays, the dwell time histogram can be visualized on a semi-log scale by pressing 
![y-log scale](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-y-log-scale.png "y-log scale").

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-plot-log.png" style="max-width:224px;">


### After fit
{: .no_toc }

After performing exponential fitting, the resulting fit function is plotter over the histogram as a solid red line.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-panel-dwell-time-histograms-plot-fit.png" style="max-width:228px;">

When the 
[Fit settings](#fit-settings) include bootstrapping, the exponential function built with bootstrap means of the fitting parameters is plotted as a red solid line.

Exponential fit functions giving the lowest and highest lifetimes are plotted in dotted lines. 
This gives an visual estimation of the cross-sample variability of state lifetimes.
