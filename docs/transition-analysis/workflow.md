# Workflow
{: .no_toc }

In this section you will learn how to determine the most sufficient state configuration from state trajectories, to obtain state transition rates and to estimate the associated cross-sample variability. 

Transition analysis results are saved in the 
[mash project](../output-files/mash-mash-project.html) and/or exported to ASCII files for traceability.

The procedure include five steps:

## Import single molecule data

Single molecule data can be imported from a 
[.mash file](../output-files/mash-mash-project.html), which ideally contains state trajectories obtained in module Trace processing, or from a set of traces written in ASCII files; see 
[Remarks](#remarks) for more details about ASCII import.

If data are imported from ASCII files, MASH must be informed about the particular file structure. 
In that case, it is recommended to export the imported data set to a new 
[.mash file](../output-files/mash-mash-project.html) in order to save analysis results and allow further review.

After successful import, the list of available data in the project (*e.g.*, intensities, FRET or stoichiometry) is shown in the 
[Data list](panels/panel-transition-density-plot.html#data-list), and the transition density plot is displayed in the 
[Visualization area](panels/area-visualization.html) for the first data in the list - intensities collected in the left-most video channel upon first laser illumination - providing that the corresponding state trajectories exist in the project; see 
[Determine state trajectories](../trace-processing/workflow.html#determine-state-trajectories) for more information about how to obtain state trajectories.

To import single molecule data:

{: .procedure }
1. Add the project to the list by pressing 
   ![Add](../assets/images/gui/TA-but-add.png "Add") and selecting the corresponding 
   [.mash file](../output-files/mash-mash-project.html)  

To import single molecule data from ASCII files:

## Build transition density plot

In a transition density plot (TDP), a transition from a state 
[*i*](){: .math_var } associated with the value 
[*val*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var } to a state 
[*i*](){: .math_var } associated with the value
[*val*<sub>*i'*</sub>](){: .math_var } is represented as a point with coordinates 
( [*val*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var };[*val*<sub>*i'*</sub>](){: .math_var } ). 

To build a TDP, state values 
[*val*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var } in trajectories are first limited to specific boundaries, and then, transitions 
( [*val*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var };[*val*<sub>*i'*</sub>](){: .math_var } ) are sorted into bins of specific size.

Ideally, transitions involving similar states assemble into clusters in the TDP: the identification of these clusters, *e. g.* by clustering algorithms, is crucial to determine the overall state configuration.

The bin size has a substantial influence on the cluster shapes: large bins will increase the overlap between neighbouring clusters until the extreme case where all clusters are merged in one, whereas short bins will spread out the clusters until the extreme case where no cluster is distinguishable.

TDP boundaries are important as they define the range of data considered for analysis.
Large data ranges can include outliers that would bias the state analysis and narrow ranges can exclude relevant contribution for state transition rate analysis.

When setting bounds to the TDP, the states laying out-of-TDP-ranges are ignored from the building process. 
To later work with state trajectories and dwell times consistent with what is seen in the TDP, state trajectories can be re-arranged by suppressing these outliers and linking the neighbouring states together.

TDP limits and bin size have to be carefully chosen in order to make transition clusters visible and sufficiently separated.

<a href="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-bin-size.png" title="Effect of bin size on TDP"><img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-bin-size.png" alt="Effect of bin size on TDP"></a>

The regular way of sorting transitions into bins, *i.e.*, summing up transition counts, will systematically favour state transitions that occur the most in trajectories at the expense of rarely occurring state transitions.
For instance, rapid interconversion of two states will appear as intense clusters whereas irreversible state transitions might be barely visible.

One way of scaling equally the two type of clusters is to assign a single transition count per trajectory, regardless the amount of times it occurs in the trajectory.
In this case, the resulting TDP maps the state configurations of single molecules and exclude the contribution of state kinetics.

Transition clusters are easier identified by eyes and by clustering algorithms if a Gaussian filter is applied to the TDP.
This has for effect to smooth the cluster's edges and to enhance the Gaussian shape of their 2D-profile.

<a href="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-tdp-processing.png" title="TDP processing"><img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-tdp-processing.png" alt="TDP processing"></a>

As the TDP is built out of *state1*-to-*state2* transitions, static state sequences are naturally not represented and the corresponding state might therefore be omitted in the final cluster configuration.

Static state sequences, and more generally last states of each sequence, can be represented as a *state1*-to-*state1* "transition", *i.e*, on the *state1*=*state2* diagonal of the TDP, and thus participate to TDP clustering.

## Determine the observablle state configuration

Clustering transition densities is equivalent to identifying the most probable configuration of states having distinct observed values.

Ideally, the TDP can be partitioned into a <u>cluster matrix</u> made of 
[*K* = *J*<sup>2</sup>](){: .math_var } clusters, with 
[*J*](){: .math_var } the number of states. 
The transitions close to the diagonal, *i. e.*, the small-amplitude state jumps rising from noise discretization, are grouped with on-diagonal one-state sequences into diagonal clusters in order to prevent the participation of noise-induced transitions to dwell-time histograms and to leave state transition rate coefficients unbiased.

However, modelling the TDP with a matrix of clusters presumes that all possible transitions between all states occur, which is usually not the case. 
Although the majority of TDPs do not resemble a cluster matrix, they do share a common feature which is the <u>symmetry of clusters</u> relative to the TDP diagonal. 
In this case, one TDP can be modelled with 
[*K* = 2*J*](){: .math_var } clusters, 
[*J*](){: .math_var } being the number of clusters on one side of the TDP diagonal.

Cluster symmetry becomes broken when irreversible state transitions are present - which is a rare case in structural dynamic studies. 
For this particular cluster configuration, the TDP is modelled with 
[*K* = *J*](){: .math_var } <u>clusters free of constraint</u>, 
[*J*](){: .math_var } being the total number of clusters.

The number 
[*J*](){: .math_var } is called the model complexity and depends on the type of cluster configuration. 
An example for 
[*J*](){: .math_var } = 4 and for each cluster configuration is given below:

<img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-panel-state-configuration-clusters-config.png">

In the case of well-separated transition clusters, 
[*K*](){: .math_var } is easily determined by eye, where a simple partition algorithm, like k-mean or manual clustering, can be used to cluster data.
However, overlapping clusters can't be accurately distinguished and need a more elaborated method.

One way of objectively identifying the number of overlapping clusters is to model the TDP by a sum of 
[*K*](){: .math_var } 2D-Gaussians, with each Gaussian modelling a cluster, such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../assets/images/equations/TA-eq-gmm.gif" alt="TDP( val_{i};val_{i'} ) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{j'=1}^{J} a_{j,j'}G_{j,j'}( val_{i};val_{i'} )">

with 
[*a*<sub>*k*</sub>](){: .math_var } the weight in the sum of the Gaussian 
[G<sub>*k*</sub>](){: .math_var } with bi-dimensional mean 
[&#956;<sub>*k*</sub>](){: .math_var } that contains information about inferred states 
( [*val*<sub>*j*</sub>](){: .math_var };[*val*<sub>*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } ), and covariance 
[*&#931;*<sub>*k*</sub>](){: .math_var } that contains information about cluster's shape.

<a href="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-clustering.png" title="Gaussian mixture clustering"><img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-clustering.png" alt="Gaussian mixture clustering"></a>

Gaussian mixtures with increasing 
[*J*](){: .math_var } are fit to the TDP.
For each 
[*J*](){: .math_var }, the models that gives the best description of the data, *i. e.*, that gives the highest likelihood, are compared to each other.

As the model likelihood fundamentally increases with the number of components, inferred models are compared via the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), with the most sufficient cluster model having the lowest BIC.

The outcome of such analysis is a single estimate of the most sufficient model, meaning that it carries no information about variability of the model across the sample.

To estimate the cross-sample variability of the most sufficient model complexity 
[*J*](){: .math_var }, the clustering procedure can be combined with TDP bootstrapping, giving the bootstrap mean 
[*&#956;*<sub>*J*</sub>](){: .math_var } and bootstrap standard deviation
[*&#963;*<sub>*J*</sub>](){: .math_var } for the given sample.
This method is similar to the bootstrap-based analysis applied to histograms and called BOBA-FRET.

To determine the most sufficient state configuration:

{: .procedure }
1. If not already done, select a data type in the 
   [Data list](panels/panel-transition-density-plot.html#data-list)  
     
1. Set parameters:  
     
   [Method settings](panels/panel-state-configuration.html#method-settings)  
   [Clusters](panels/panel-state-configuration.html#clusters)  
     
1. Start inference of state configurations by pressing 
   ![cluster](../assets/images/gui/TA-but-cluster.png "cluster"); after completion, the display is instantly updated with the most sufficient Gaussian mixture

## Estimate state lifetimes 

## Estimate the kinetic model and associated transition rate coefficients

We've just seen how multiple state sequences are grouped to give a global state configuration.
Up to now, states have distinct observed values, which allows us to collect the associated dwell times in all state sequences and build dwell time histograms.
To solve the kinetic model that desscribe our data set, we must:
- Disantangle the potential degenerated states hidden behind observed states (degenerated states share the same observed value but differ in their kinetics),
- identify allowed/forbidden state transitions and quantify the associated rate coefficients.

To ease the comprehension, a kinetic model is represented as a treilli diagram, where states are depicted by circles and allowed transitions by arrows.
For instance, the kinetic model of 2 observed FRET states (
[*FRET*<sub>1</sub>](){: .math_var}=0.2 and 
[*FRET*<sub>2</sub>](){: .math_var}=0.7) with one state being degenerated three times can be depicted as:

<a href="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-treilli-example.png" title="Four-state kinetic model"><img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-treilli-example.png" alt="Illustration of a four-state kinetic model"></a>

where 
[*k*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var} is the rate coefficient that governs transitions from state 
[*j*](){: .math_var } to 
[*j'*](){: .math_var }.
Rate coeffcicients are equivalent to the transformation frequency (in events per second) of a molecule in state 
[*j*](){: .math_var } to state 
[*j'*](){: .math_var }.

#### Characterization of state degeneracy

By definition, the dwell times of an unambiguous state follow a single exponential distribution. 
The presence of degenerated states usually breaks this simple shape by introducing multiple decays.

<a href="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-dt-degen.png" title="Dwell time histograms with and without degeneracy"><img src="../assets/images/figures/TA-workflow-scheme-dt-degen.png" alt="Illustration of degeneracy in dwell time histograms"></a>

In MASH-FRET, state degeneracy is determined from dwell time histgrams via two methods:
- estimation of the most sufficient **discrete-phase type distribution**
- fit of a **mixture of exponentials** (weighted sum of exponential)

Historically, the number of degenerated states, or degeneracy, is determined as the number of components in the mixture necessary to describe the histogram.
However, the 
As time-binned data suffer from an absence of dwell times below 1 data point, the normalized complementary cumulative dwell time histogram is used. 
This minimizes the impact of this first histogram bin while preserving the overall shape.


Transition rate coefficients can be determined from the cumulative histogram of dwell times 
[&#916;*t*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } in state 
[*j*](){: .math_var } prior transiting to state 
[*j'*](){: .math_var } by fitting an exponential decay function such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../assets/images/equations/TA-kin-ana-01.gif" alt="1- F\left ( \Delta t_{j,j'} \right ) = {exp( - k_{j,j'}\Delta t_{j,j'} )}">

with 
[*F*( &#916;*t*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub> )](){: .math_var } the cumulative histogram normalized between 0 and 1 and 
[*k*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var} in second<sup>-1</sup>.

For heterogeneous systems, the dwell time histogram is not sufficiently described by a single exponential decay and must be described either by the sum of 
[*Z*](){: .math_var } exponential functions weighted by the respective 
[*a*<sub>*z*</sub>](){: .math_var } coefficients, such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../assets/images/equations/TA-kin-ana-02.gif" alt="1- F( \Delta t_{j,j'}) = \sum_{z=1}^{Z}[ a_{z}exp( - k_{j,j',z}\Delta t_{j,j'} ) ]">

or by a stretched exponential function, such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../assets/images/equations/TA-kin-ana-03.gif" alt="1- F( \Delta t_{j,j'} ) = exp[ - ( k_{j,j'}\Delta t_{j,j'} )^{\beta_{j,j'}} ]">

with the stretching exponent 
[*&#946;*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } being an indicator of the degree of heterogeneity 
([*&#946;*](){: .math_var } = 0.5 indicates a bi-exponential decay function).

The outcome of such analysis are single estimates of the transition rate coefficients.
One way to estimate the variability of fitting parameters across the sample is to use the bootstrap-based analysis called BOBA-FRET.
BOBA-FRET applies to all fit functions, and infers the bootstrap means and bootstrap standard deviations of all fitting parameters for the given sample, including 
[*&#956;*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var } and 
[*&#963;*<sub>*j*,*j'*</sub>](){: .math_var }, the mean and standard deviation for transition rate coefficients.

To determine the transition rate coefficients:

{: .procedure }
1. Select the state transition in the 
   [Transitions](panels/panel-state-transition-rates.html#transitions)  
     
1. Set parameters:  
     
   [Method settings](panels/panel-state-transition-rates.html#method-settings)  
   [Fitting parameters](panels/panel-state-transition-rates.html#method-settings)  
     
1. Start exponential fit by pressing 
   ![Fit](../assets/images/gui/TA-but-fit.png); after completion, the display is instantly updated with fitting results

## Remarks
{: .no_toc }

For the moment only FRET state trajectories can be imported.
Additionally, imported state trajectories are only available in module Histogram analysis and Transition analysis: if the project is loaded and saved in module Trace processing, state trajectories will be overwritten by newly calculated ones. 
This compatibility problem will be managed in the future.
