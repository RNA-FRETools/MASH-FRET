# Set export options
{: .no_toc }

Export options define the particular files to export from an analysis with module Transition analysis.

The window is accessed by pressing 
![Export](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-export.png "Export") in the project management area of module Transition analysis.

Press 
![Next >>](../../assets/images/gui/TA-but-next-supsup.png "Next >>") to start file export.

## Transition density plot (TDP)

Use this panel to export the TDP and clustering results.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-area-project-management-export-tdp.png" style="max-width: 219px;"/>

The TDP can be exported to ASCII files by activating the option in **(a)**.
In this case, the TDP can be exported in the different format listed in **(b)**:
* `matrix(*.tdp)`: exported as a matrix
* `gauss. convoluted matrix(*.tdp)`: exported as a Gaussian-filtered matrix
* `coordinates (x,y,occurrence)(*.txt)`: exported as 3D-coordinates
* `all(*.tdp, *.txt)`: all three formats

For more information about the file structures, please refer to 
[Transition density plot file](../../output-files/tdp-transition-density-plot.html) and 
[Transition density coordinates file](../../output-files/txt-transition-density-coordinates.html).

The TDP matrix can also be exported to a PNG image file by activating the option in **(c)** and selecting one of the plot listed in **(d)**:
* `original`: shows initial transition counts
* `Gaussian-convoluted`: shows Gaussian-filtered counts
* `all`: export both images

**Note:** *Transition densities written in files are counted as defined in 
[Transition count](../panels/panel-transition-density-plot.html#transition-count)*

## Kinetic analysis

Use this panel to export dwell time histograms and fitting results.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-area-project-management-export-kin.png" style="max-width: 210px;"/>

Dwell time histograms can be exported to ASCII 
[.hdt files](../../output-files/hdt-dwelltime-histogram.html) by activating the options in **(a)**.

Fitting results can also be exported to separated ASCII
[.fit files](../../output-files/fit-dwelltime-fit.html) by activating the option in **(b)**. 

If the 
[Fit settings](../panels/panel-dwell-time-histograms.html#fit-settings) include BOBA-FRET:
* the [.fit file](../../output-files/fit-dwelltime-fit.html) can be appended with bootstrapping parameters and results by activating the option in **(c)**
* plots of bootstrap histogram samples and associated fit can be exported to a multi-pages [.pdf file](../../output-files/pdf-transition-analysis-bootstrap-plots.html) by activating the option in **(d)**

## Kinetic model

Use this panel to export results of model selection on DPHs, the kinetic model parameters and simulated data.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TA-area-project-management-export-model.png" style="max-width: 201px;"/>

If state degeneracy was determined with model selection on DPHs, the BIC values obtained for all state degeneracy can be summarize in ASCII 
[.txt files](../../output-files/txt-dph-model-select.html) by activating the options in **(a)**.

The inferred kinetic model including state values, lifetimes, initial probabilities and transition rate coefficients can be exported to ASCII 
[.txt files](../../output-files/txt-kinetic-model.html) by activating the options in **(b)**.

The synthetic dwell time set created with the kinetic model parameters can be exported to ASCII 
[.dt files](../../output-files/dt-dwelltimes.html) by activating the options in **c)**.
