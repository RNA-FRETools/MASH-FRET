# Visualization area
{: .no_toc }

The visualization area is the main display of module Simulation. 

Use this area to visualize simulated data and control action logs.

## Control panel 

Lists the action logs. 

Actions are automatically saved in a 
[daily log file](../../output-files/log-daily-logs.html).


---

## Intensity histograms

Shows the donor (blue) and acceptor (red) intensity distributions in simulated intensity-time traces of molecule n:°1. 

Histograms are built with the MATLAB built-in function `histcounts` that determines the optimal number of bins.

Intensity units are set in 
[Intensity units](panel-export-options.html#intensity-units).

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.

## Simulated intensity-time traces

Shows the simulated donor (blue) and acceptor (red) intensity-time traces for molecule n:°1. 

Intensity units are set in 
[Intensity units](panel-export-options.html#intensity-units).

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.

---


## Simulated video

Shows the first frame of the simulated single molecule video. 

The color scale for pixel values is indicated by the color bar. Pixel intensity units are set in 
[Intensity units](panel-export-options.html#intensity-units).

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.
