# Simulation
{: .no_toc }

Simulation is the first module of MASH-FRET and is accessed by pressing 
![Simulation](assets/images/gui/sim-but-simulation.png "Simulation") in the main 
[tool bar](Getting_started.html#interface).

Use this module to  generate synthetic data (single molecule videos and trajectories). 
Simulation framework is limited to <u>surface-immobilized</u> molecules, <u>two</u> spectroscopic channels (one donor and one acceptor) and <u>continuous wavelength</u> excitation (no ALEX). 
See 
[Create a new project](Getting_started.html#create-a-new-project) to get started. 

Learn about the main simulation procedure in the 
[Workflow](simulation/workflow.html) section, special functionalities in 
[Functionalities](simulation/functionalities.html) and individual interface components in 
[Components](simulation/components.html).
