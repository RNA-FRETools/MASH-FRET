# Interface
{: .no_toc }

Simulation is the first module of MASH-FRET and is accessed by pressing 
![Simulation](../assets/images/gui/sim-but-simulation.png "Simulation") in the main 
[tool bar](../Getting_started.html#interface).

The interface is divided into three subunits that respectively allow to:
* <u>generate</u> data
* <u>visualize</u> generated data
* <u>export</u> generated data
