# Video processing

Video processing is the second module of MASH-FRET and is accessed by pressing 
![Video processing](assets/images/gui/VP-but-video-processing.png "Video processing") in the main 
[tool bar](Getting_started.html#interface).

Use this module to obtain single molecule intensity-time traces from a single molecule video. 

Video processing recieves as input video data read from *.<u>sif</u>, *.<u>spe</u>, *.<u>pma</u>, *.<u>avi</u>, *.<u>tif</u>, *.<u>gif</u>, *.<u>ets</u> (associated with a *.<u>vsi</u> file) and 
*.[<u>sira</u>](output-files/sira-mash-video.html) files. 
Its framework is limited to <u>surface-immobilized</u> molecules (molecule tracking is not available).
See 
[Create a new project](Getting_started.html#create-a-new-project) to get started.
