## Project parameters

Use this panel to define the project title and some optional parameters.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-projprm.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-projprm.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

The project title is the name appearing in the project lists. 
It can be defined in **(a)** or default title can be used by leaving **(a)** empty.
By default, projects are titled after the corresponding 
[.mash file](../../output-files/mash-mash-project.html) or after the source directory when traces are imported from ASCII files.

Optional project parameters include the name of the molecule under study, set in **(b)**, and a group of experimental parameters, set in **(c)**.
By default, the group in **(c)** contains parameters:
* `[Mg2+]`: milimolar (`mM`) concentration of Magnesium,
* `[K+] `: milimolar (`mM`) concentration of Potassium,
* `Power(xxxnm)`: power in `mW` of laser with wavelength xxxnm

The user can add personal parameters to the default group.
To do so, the parameter name (here: `buffer nÂ°`) and units (here: empty) must be set in **(e)** and **(f)** respectively, prior pressing 
![Add](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-add.png "Add").
All user-defined parameters are listed in **(d)** and can be removed by pressing 
![Remove](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-remove.png "Remove"). 

For the moment, optional parameters solely act as project "tags" saved with the 
[MASH project file](../../output-files/mash-mash-project.html) and exported in
[Processing parameter files](../../output-files/log-processing-parameters.html).

## Video channels

Use this panel to define the channel labels and excitation selectivity.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-channels.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-channels.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

Channel labels are used to easily identify calculated and plotted data. 
Usually, the channel is labelled after the emitter from which photons are collected (ex: `Cy5`).

Emitters are usually excited by one particular laser. 
Knowing the excitation selectivity is necessary for FRET and stoichiometry calculations.

Channel label and excitation wavelength are set by first selecting the channel index in list **(a)** and then selecting the desired label and excitation wavelength in list **(b)** and **(c)** respectively.
Channel indexes correspond to the order of appearance in the video from left to right.

The user can add personal labels to the list **(d)** by writing the new label name in **(e)** and pressing 
![Add](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-add.png "Add"). 
Labels can be removed from the list any time by pressing 
![Remove](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-remove.png "Remove").

## FRET calculations

Use this panel to define the FRET pairs.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-fret.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-fret.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

To define a donor-acceptor pair in the multiple FRET-pair network, labels must be selected in list **(a)** and **(b)** respectively prior pressing 
![Add](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-add.png "Add").
All FRET pairs included in the network are listed in **(c)** and can be removed any time by pressing 
![Remove](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-remove.png "Remove").

In a FRET-pair network composed of several emitters, quantities of energy absorbed by each of the emitters can be emitted as light or transferred via FRET to other emitters providing a non-negligible overlap of the donor emission spectrum with the absorption spectra of the acceptors. 

These energy movements can be represented on a scheme where:
- emitters are numbered according to the red shift of the absorption spectrum
- the energy quantity absorbed by emitter 
[*i*](){: .math_var } exclusively is noted 
[*q*<sub>0,*i*</sub>](){: .math_var }, 
- the quantity of energy emitted by emitter 
[*i*](){: .math_var } is noted 
[*q*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var },
- the energy quantity transferred by FRET from emitter 
[*i*](){: .math_var } to emitter 
[*j*](){: .math_var } is noted 
[*q*<sub>*i*,*j*</sub>](){: .math_var }.

For example, the energy movements in a FRET-pair network composed of four emitters with different absorption and emission properties are summarized in the following scheme.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme.png"><img src="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

In an ideal system that includes radiative processes and energy transfers only, the law of conservation of energy supposed that:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-01.gif" alt="q_{i}=q_{0,i}+\sum_{j<i}q_{j,i}-\sum_{j>i}q_{i,j}"/>

The energy quantity 
[*q*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var} is comparable to the intensity detected in emission channel of emitter 
[*i*](){: .math_var} and corrected from background and cross-talks. 
Thus, 
[*q*<sub>*i*</sub>](){: .math_var} values are measured during the experiment.

The apparent efficiency 
[*E*\*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var} of an energy transfer from a donor 
[*D*](){: .math_var} to an acceptor 
[*A*](){: .math_var} is calculated as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-02.gif" alt="E_{D,A}^{*}=\frac{q_{D,A}}{q_{D}+q_{D,A}}"/>

To obtain the probability of energy transfer 
[*E*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var}, which is inversely proportional to the distance 
[*r*](){: .math_var} between the two dyes, 
[*E*\*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var} must later be corrected by considering (1) the different quantities of non-radiative energy lost during the process by both emitters 
[*D*](){: .math_var} and 
[*A*](){: .math_var} as well as (2) the different detection efficiencies of photons emitted by emitters
[*D*](){: .math_var} and 
[*A*](){: .math_var}; see 
[Correct ratio values](../../trace-processing/workflow.html#correct-ratio-values) for more information.

The energy quantity 
[*q*<sub>*i*,*j*</sub>](){: .math_var} is calculated from intensities measured upon different laser illuminations, <u>starting with specific excitation of the most red-shifted donor</u>. 
For the limiting case where the most red-shifted donor transfers energy to multiple acceptors, FRET efficiencies can not be analytically calculated.

Translated in a four-emitter network, the most red-shifted donor is the emitter 3, which can transfer energy to emitter 4 only. 
This comes down to a simple two-emitter network where energy movements can be depicted as in the following scheme.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc3.png"><img src="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc3.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

Using the law of conservation of energy and the definition of the apparent FRET efficiency of the donor-acceptor pair 3- 4, we can readily calculate 
[*E*\*<sub>3,4</sub>](){: .math_var} from measured intensities such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-05.gif" alt="E_{3,4}^*=\frac{q_{3,4}}{q_3+q_{3,4}}=\frac{q_4}{q_3+q_4}=\frac{I_4^3}{I_3^3+I_4^3}"/>

The next most red-shifted donor is the emitter 2, which can transfer energy to emitters 3 and 4. 
This comes down to a three-emitter network where energy movements can be depicted as in the following scheme.
 
<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc2.png"><img src="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc2.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

Using the law of conservation of energy and the definition of the apparent FRET efficiencies of the donor-acceptor pairs 2- 3 and 2-4, we can express
[*E*\*<sub>2,3</sub>](){: .math_var} and
[*E*\*<sub>2,4</sub>](){: .math_var} in function of measured intensities and the quantity 
[*q*<sub>3,4</sub>](){: .math_var} such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-07.gif" alt="E_{2,3}^*=\frac{q_{2,3}}{q_{2,3}+q_2}=\left (1+\frac{q_2}{q_3+q_{3,4}}\right )^{-1} = \left ( 1+\frac{I_2^2}{I_3^2+q_{3,4}}\right )^{-1}"/><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-08.gif" alt="E_{2,4}^*=\frac{q_{2,4}}{q_{2,4}+q_2}=\left (1+\frac{q_2}{q_4-q_{3,4}}\right )^{-1} = \left ( 1+\frac{I_2^2}{I_4^2-q_{3,4}}\right )^{-1}"/>

According to the definition of the apparent FRET efficiency, 
[*q*<sub>3,4</sub>](){: .math_var} can be expressed in function of measured intensities and the known 
[*E*\*<sub>3,4</sub>](){: .math_var}, such as:

<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-09.gif" alt="q_{3,4}=\frac{E_{3,4}^*}{1-E_{3,4}^*}I_3^2"/>

Put together, these equations allow to calculate 
[*E*\*<sub>2,3</sub>](){: .math_var} and
[*E*\*<sub>2,4</sub>](){: .math_var} in function of measured intensities and the known 
[*E*\*<sub>3,4</sub>](){: .math_var}, such as:

<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-10.gif" alt="E_{2,3}^*= \left ( 1+\frac{I_2^2}{I_3^2+\frac{E_{3,4}^*}{1-E_{3,4}^*}I_3^2}\right )^{-1}=\left [ 1+\frac{I_2^2\left( 1-E_{3,4}^*\right )}{I_3^2}\right ]^{-1}"/><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-11.gif" alt="E_{2,4}^*= \left ( 1+\frac{I_2^2}{I_4^2-\frac{E_{3,4}^*}{1-E_{3,4}^*}I_3^2}\right )^{-1}"/>

The next most red-shifted donor is the emitter 1, which can transfer energy to emitters 1, 3 and 4. 
Energy movements can be depicted as in the following scheme:
 
<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc1.png"><img src="../../assets/images/figures/VP-FRET-calculations-4-color-scheme-exc1.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

FRET efficiencies for the FRET pairs 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4 are determined using the same deductive path as presented above, giving:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-12.gif" alt=""/><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-13.gif" alt=""/><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-14.gif" alt=""/>

This demonstration can be generalized to a 
[*K*](){: .math_var }-emitter network with the apparent FRET efficiency 
[*E*\*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var} â of a donor-acceptor pair 
[*D*](){: .math_var }-[*A*](){: .math_var } with 
[*A*](){: .math_var }>[*D*](){: .math_var } â being calculated from intensities detected upon excitation of emitter 
[*D*](){: .math_var } and apparent FRET efficiencies obtained from more red-shifted FRET-pairs, such as:

<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-fret-calc-15.gif" alt="E_{D,A}^*= \left \{ 1+\frac{I_{D,em}^{D,ex}}{I_{A,em}^{D,ex} \left [1+\sum_{i>A}\left (\frac{E_{A,i}^*}{1-E_{A,i}^*}\right )\right ] -\sum_{D<i<A}\left( \frac{E_{i,A}^*}{1-E_{i,A}^*}I_{i,em}^{D,ex}\right )}  \right \}^{-1}"/>

with 
[*I*<sub>*k*,em</sub><sup>*k'*,ex,\*\*\*</sup>](){: .math_var } the intensity collected in channel specific to emitter 
[*k*](){: .math_var }, upon laser illumination that specifically excites emitter 
[*k'*](){: .math_var }, and after background and cross-talk corrections.

## Stoichiometry calculations

Use this panel to define the emitter stoichiometries to be calculated and plotted.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-s.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/VP-panel-expset-opt-s.png" style="max-width: 250px;"/></a>

The stoichiometry of an emitter is usually used to estimate the ratio of different emitters attached to the single molecule under observation.

The apparent stoichiometry 
[*S*\*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var } for a FRET pair composed of donor emitter 
[*D*](){: .math_var } and an acceptor emitter 
[*A*](){: .math_var }, specifically excited by the respective illuminations 
[*D*<sub>ex</sub>](){: .math_var } and 
[*A*<sub>ex</sub>](){: .math_var } in a labelling scheme consisting of 
[*K*](){: .math_var } emitters, is calculated as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/VP-eq-s-calc.gif" alt="S_{D,A}^{*} = \frac{\sum_{k}\left (I_{k,em}^{D,ex} \right )}{\sum_{k}\left( I_{k,em}^{D,ex} + I_{k,em}^{A,ex} \right ) }">

with 
[*I*<sub>*k*,em</sub><sup>*k'*,ex,\*\*\*</sup>](){: .math_var } the intensity collected in channel specific to emitter 
[*k*](){: .math_var }, upon laser illumination that specifically excites emitter 
[*k'*](){: .math_var }, and after background and cross-talk corrections.

To obtain the stoichiometry
[*S*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var}, which correspond to the ratio of different emitters attached to the single molecule under observation, 
[*S*\*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var} must later be corrected by considering the differences for emitters 
[*D*](){: .math_var} and 
[*A*](){: .math_var} in: (1) quantities of non-radiative energy lost during the process by the emitters, (2) camera detection efficiencies of emitter photons, (3) quantities of energy released by the emitter-specific illuminations, (4) quantities of energy absorbed by the emitters; see 
[Correct ratio values](../../trace-processing/workflow.html#correct-ratio-values) for more information.

A stoichiometry 
[*S*<sub>*D*,*A*</sub>](){: .math_var } = 0.5 means that half of the total number of 
[*D*](){: .math_var }  and 
[*A*](){: .math_var }  emitters attached to the molecule are  
[*D*](){: .math_var } emitters.

To activate the stoichiometry calculation for a FRET pair in particular, the FRET pair must be selected in **(a)** prior pressing 
![Add](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-add.png "Add").
All desired stoichiometry calculations are listed in **(b)** and can be removed any time by pressing 
![Remove](../../assets/images/gui/VP-but-remove.png "Remove").
