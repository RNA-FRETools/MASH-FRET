# System requirements

The different versions of MASH-FRET were developped with different versions of MATLAB and on different operating systems. The correct functioning of MASH-FRET can only be guaranteed for these working environments:
- MASH-FRET **1.3.3** with MATLAB 9.12 (2022a) on Linux-Unbuntu 22.04.
- MASH-FRET **1.3.2** with MATLAB 9.10 (2021a) on Linux-Unbuntu 20.04.
- MASH-FRET **1.3.1** with MATLAB 9.9 (2020b) on Windows 8.1 and Linux-Unbuntu 20.04.
- Earlier releases of MASH-FRET were developped with MATLAB (2016a) on Windows 8.1

In case of malfunctioning in your working environment, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RNA-FRETools/MASH-FRET/issues) of Github to inform us. We will do what is possible to fix the problem.

MASH-FRET additionally requires the following MATLAB toolboxes:
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Curve Fitting Toolbox

To check whether these toolboxes are installed on your system, go to MASH-FRET's menu `Tools â†’ Check toolbox dependencies` and run the `Analysis mode`.
