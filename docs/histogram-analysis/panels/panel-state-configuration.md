# State configuration
{: .no_toc }

State configuration is the second panel of module Histograms analysis.

Use this panel to determine the optimum number of histogram peaks.

## Maximum number of Gaussians

Defines the maximum model complexity to consider for model fitting, *i.e.*, the maximum number of Gaussian in the Gaussian mixture models to infer; see 
[Determine the most sufficient state configuration](../workflow.html#determine-the-most-sufficient-state-configuration) in Histogram analysis worklow for more information about state configuration analysis.

The maximum number of Gaussian in the model is the only parameter necessary to infer models.

Press 
![Start analysis](../../assets/images/gui/HA-but-start-analysis.png) to start model inference.

<u>default</u>: 10

## Model penalty

Use this interface to define model overfitting penalty.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/HA-panel-state-configuration-penalty.png" style="max-width: 160px;"/>

The overfitting penalty can be modified before or after inferring the different models, *i.e.*, before or after pressing 
![Start analysis](../../assets/images/gui/HA-but-start-analysis.png).

Model overfitting can be penalized in two ways:

* Minimum improvement in likelihood, by activating the option in **(a)** 
* using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), by activating the option in **(c)**


### Minimum improvement in likelihood
{: .no_toc }

With this penalty, a certain improvement in the model <u>log</u>-likelihood is expected when adding a new component to the model. 
The improvement is expressed as a multiplication factor that can be set in **(b)**.
For instance, set a penalty of 1.2 for an improvement of 20% in the <u>log</u>-likelihood, or of 10<sup>0.2</sup> in the likelihood.

The most sufficient model is the least complex model for which adding a component does not fulfil this requirement.


### Bayesian information criterion
{: .no_toc }

The BIC is used to rank models according to their sufficiency, with the most sufficient model having the lowest 
[*BIC*](){: .math_var }.

The 
[*BIC*](){: .math_var } is similar to a penalized likelihood and it is expressed such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/HA-eq-bic.gif" alt="BIC\left (J \right ) = p\left (J \right ) \times \log ( N_{\textup{total}} ) - 2 \times \log \left [ likelihood\left (J \right ) \right ]">

with 
[*p*](){: .math_var } the number of parameters necessary to describe the model with 
[*J*](){: .math_var } components and
[*N*<sub>total</sub>](){: .math_var } the total number of counts in the histogram.

The number of parameters necessary to describe the model includes the number of Gaussian means 
[*p*<sub>means</sub>](){: .math_var }, standard deviations 
[*p*<sub>widths</sub>](){: .math_var } and relative weights 
[*p*<sub>weights</sub>](){: .math_var }, and is calculated such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/HA-eq-bic-02.gif" alt="p\left ( J\right ) = p_{\textup{means}} + p_{\textup{widths}} + p_{\textup{weights}} = 3J - 1">

## Inferred models

Use this interface to visualize the results of state configuration analysis.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/HA-panel-state-configuration-models.png" style="max-width: 150px;"/>

The number of components in the most sufficient model according to the 
[Model penalty](#model-penalty) is displayed in **(a)**.

Other inferred models can be visualized in the 
[Top axes](area-visualization.html#top-axes) by selecting the corresponding number of components in the list **(b)**. 
In this case, the log-likelihood and BIC of the selected model are respectively displayed in **(c)** and **(d)**.

The parameters of any model can be imported in 
[Thresholding](panel-state-populations#thresholding) or 
[Gaussian fitting](panel-state-populations#gaussian-fitting) as starting guess for state population analysis, by pressing 
![>>](../../assets/images/gui/HA-but-supsup.png ">>").

Analysis results are summarized in a bar plot where the BIC or the increase in log-likelihood is presented in function of the number of components, depending on the chosen 
[Model penalty](#model-penalty).

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.
