# Kinetic model files
{: .no_toc }

Kinetic model files are ASCII files with the extension `.txt`. They are usually found in the main`/transition-analysis/kinetic model` analysis folder.

## Description

Kinetic model files are data-specific and contain parameters of the kinetic model inferred in Transition analysis.

They are created in the `/transition_analysis/kinetic-model` analysis sub-folder when exporting results in window 
[Export options](../transition-analysis/functionalities/set-export-options.html#kinetic-model) of module Transition analysis.

## File name

The file is named by the user during the export process.
By default, the file is named after the selected <u>project file</u>.

The file name is appended with the extension `_[Ddd]_mdl` where `[Ddd]` is the data type written in the file.

Data types supported in dwell time files are:
* `I[i]-[L]`: intensities in detection channel indexed `[i]` upon illumination with laser wavelength `[L]` nm
* `FRET[D]to[A]`: FRET from donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` to acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`
* `S[D]to[A]`: stoichiometry associated to donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` and acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`

## Structure

The parameters of the inferred kinetic model are organized column-wise with:
* column `states` containing state indexes
* column `values` containing state values
* column `lifetimes(s)` containing the state lifetimes calculated as the inverse sum of the exit rate coefficients
* column `initial prob.` containing the state initial probabilities
* columns `k(s-1)` containing the matrix of transition rate coefficients where row numbers correspond to the state index before transition and column numbers to the state after transition
* columns `+dk(s-1)` and `-dk(s-1)` containing the positive and negative errors of transition rate coefficients calculated as described in Transition analysis 
  [Workflow](../transition-analysis/workflow.html#via-transition-probabilities)
