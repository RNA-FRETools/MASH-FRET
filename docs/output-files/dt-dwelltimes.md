# Dwell time files
{: .no_toc }

Dwell time files are ASCII files with the extension `.dt`. They are usually found in the main`/simulations/dwell-times`, main`/traces_processing/dwell-times` or main`/transition-analysis/kinetic model` analysis folders.

## Description

The dwell time files are written in ASCII format and contain state durations in the corresponding single molecule state trajectory.

They are created in the `/simulations/dwell-times` analysis sub-folder when exported from module Simulation, in `trace_processing/dwell-times` when exported from module Trace processing, or in `/transition-analysis/kinetic model` when exported from Transition analysis.

They are created when:
- exporting simulated dwell times in panel 
[Export options](../simulation/panels/panel-export-options.html) of module Simulation
- exporting processed dwell times in window 
[Export options](../trace-processing/functionalities/set-export-options.html#export-dwell-times) of module Trace processing
- exporting simulated dwell times in window 
[Export options](../transition-analysis/functionalities/set-export-options.html#kinetic-model) of module Transition analysis

## File name

The file is named by the user during the export process.
By default, when exported from modules 
[Trace processing](../trace-processing/panels/area-project-management.html#project-list) and 
[Transition analysis](../transition-analysis/panels/area-management.html#project-list), the file is named after the selected <u>project file</u>.

If the file contains dwell times for single trajectories, the file name is appended with the extension `_mol[n]of[N]`, where `[n]` is the index of the molecule written in the file and  `[N]` the total number of exported molecules.
In any case, the file name is appended with the final extension `_[Ddd]` where `[Ddd]` is the data type written in the file.

Data types supported in dwell time files are:
* `I[i]-[L]`: intensities in detection channel indexed `[i]` upon illumination with laser wavelength `[L]` nm
* `FRET[D]to[A]`: FRET from donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` to acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`
* `S[D]to[A]`: stoichiometry associated to donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` and acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`

## Structure

Dwell times are organized column-wise with:
* column `dwell-time (second)` containing state durations in second before transition
* (optional) column `molecule` containing molecule indexes
* column `state` containing state values or indexes before transition
* column `state after transition` containing state values or indexes after transitions

```
dwell-time (second)	molecule	state	state after transition
5.189148e+00	1	2	3	
2.950692e+00	1	3	NaN	
1.861988e+01	2	2	3
```

The last value in column `state after transition` is set to `NaN` when the state after transition is unknown, *e. g.* when the last dwell time is truncated by the limited observation time.
