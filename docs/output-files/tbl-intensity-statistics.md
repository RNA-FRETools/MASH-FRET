# Intensity statistics files
{: .no_toc }

Intensity statistics files are ASCII files with the extension `.tbl`. They are usually found in the main`/video_processing/intensities/statistics` analysis folder.

## Description

Intensity statistics files are are written in ASCII format and contain statistics on single molecule intensity-time traces created from video.

They are automatically created in the `/video_processing/intensities/statistics` analysis sub-folder after creating and exporting ASCII traces in panel 
[Intensity integration](/video-processing/panels/panel-intensity-integration.html#create-and-export-intensity-time-traces) of module Video processing.


---

## File name

The file is named by the user during the export process.

By default, the file is named after the <u>video file</u> name loaded in 
[Video processing](../video-processing.html), and is appended with the extension `_all[N]` where `[N]` the total number of single molecules in the file.

## Structure

Intensity statistics are organized column-wise with:
* columns `x[i]` and `y[i]` containing the respective x- and y- coordinates of single molecules in detection channel `[i]`
* columns `signal[i] at[X]nm(average)` and `noise[i] at[X]nm` respectively containing the mean and standard deviation of the single molecule intensity time-trace in detection channel `[i]` and upon illumination with laser wavelength `[X]`

For consistency, intensities are always given as the sum of the brightest pixel intensities per video frame, regardless the units defined in
[Pixel intensity units](../video-processing/panels/panel-plot.html#pixel-intensity-units).
