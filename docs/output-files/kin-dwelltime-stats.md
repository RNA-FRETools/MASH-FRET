# Dwell time statistics
{: .no_toc }

Dwell time statistics files are ASCII files with the extension `.kin`. They are usually found in the main`/traces_processing/dwell-times` analysis folder.

## Description

Dwell time statistics files are written in ASCII format and contain statistics on state transitions and state durations in all exported state trajectories.

They are created in the `trace_processing/dwell-times` analysis sub-folder after exporting .kin files from window 
[Export options](../trace-processing/functionalities/set-export-options.html#export-dwell-times) of module Trace processing.

## File name

The file is named by the user during the export process.

By default the file is named after the selected <u>project file</u> and is appended with the extension `_[Ddd]`, where `[Ddd]` the data type written in the file.

Data types supported in dwell time statistics files are:
* `I[i]-[L]`: intensities in detection channel indexed `[i]` upon illumination with laser wavelength `[L]` nm
* `FRET[D]to[A]`: FRET from donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` to acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`
* `S[D]to[A]`: stoichiometry associated to donor emitter detected in channel indexed `[D]` and acceptor emitter detected in channel indexed `[A]`


---

## Structure

Dwell time statistics are organized column-wise with:
* column `file name` containing names of exported dwell time files from which statistics are calculated
* columns `state1` and `state2` containing state values before and after transition respectively
* columns `total time spent in [j]` containing summed durations of state `[j]` (in second)
* columns `average time in [j]` containing average duration of state `[j]` in the trajectory (in second)
* columns `ratio average time 1/2` containing the ratio of the average dwell time before transition over the average dwell time after transition; this can be used as an approximation of the thermodynamic constant for a two-state system

```

If a state transition is not found reversible in the dwell time file, columns `total time spent in [j]` are set to `0` and columns `average time in [j]` as well as `ratio average time 1/2` are set to `NaN`.
