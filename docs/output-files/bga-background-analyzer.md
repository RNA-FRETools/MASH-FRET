# Background analyzer files
{: .no_toc }

Background analyzer files are ASCII files with the extension `.bga`. They are usually found in the main analysis folder.

## Description

Background analyzer files are data-specific and contain background intensities for all molecules in the project, calculated by screening method parameters.

They are created in the main analysis folder after saving results from window 
[Background analyzer](../trace-processing/functionalities/use-background-analyzer.html) of module Trace processing.


---

## File name

The file is named after the selected <u>project file</u> in module 
[Trace processing](../trace-processing/panels/area-project-management.html#project-list) with the extension `_[Eee]-[L]nm`, where `[Eee]` is the label given to the detection channel and `[L]` the laser excitation wavelength.


---

## Structure

Background intensities are organized column-wise with:
* columns `subimage_size(pix)` and `param_1` containing the first and second method parameters
* columns  `mean_value` and `std_value` containing the mean and standard deviations of background intensities calculated for all molecules, using units defined in 
[Intensity units](../trace-processing/panels/panel-plot.html#intensity-units)
* columns `mol_[n]` containing background intensities calculated for molecule `[n]`
