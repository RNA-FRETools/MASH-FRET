{% include tutorial_head.html %}

In this step, state configuration, state populations and state transition rates obtained from the analysis of simulated data and experimental data are compared.

For a concrete example, you can refer to the scientific article 
[A Two-Step Method for smFRET Data Analysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b05697).
