# Analyze data
{: .no_toc }

Follow this procedure to process your single molecule videos (SMVs) or trajectories and characterize the molecule dynamics in your sample.

**Note:** *Skip step 1 if already in possession of intensity-time traces files (ASCII or 
[mash project](../../output-files/mash-mash-project)).*

{% include tutorial_toc.html %}

{% include tutorial_head.html %}

In this step, single molecules are sorted, intensity-time traces are corrected from experimental bias and state sequences are inferred for individual traces.

## Setup working area

Intensity-time trace correction, sorting and discretization is done with module Trace processing.
Traces can be imported from the **.mash project file** created in 
[Step 1](create-traces.html#steps) or from a **set of ASCII files**.

To prepare the working area for processing:

{: .procedure }
1. Select module 
   [Trace processing](../../trace-processing.html) by pressing 
   ![Trace processing](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-trace-processing.png "Trace processing") in the main 
   [tool bar](../../Getting_started.html#interface)  
     
1. Press 
   ![Add](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-add.png "Add") in 
   [Project management](../../trace-processing/panels/area-project-management.html) and select the 
   [mash project](../../output-files/mash-mash-project) file exported in 
   [Step 1](create-traces.html#steps); to import traces from ASCII files, please refer to 
   [Import single molecule data](../../trace-processing/workflow.html#import-single-molecule-data)  
     
1. If not already done in 
   [Step 1](create-traces.html#steps), open and set project options by pressing 
   ![Edit...](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-edit-3p.png "Edit...") in 
   [Project management](../../trace-processing/panels/area-project-management.html)

## Correct for experimental bias

Intensity-time traces must be corrected from experimental bias to obtain state trajectories that describe molecule dynamics the most accurately.

Experimental bias include shifts in molecule positions, background light and cross-talks between wavelength ranges used for emitter detection (bleedthrough) and excitation (direct excitation).

To adjust single molecule positions in panel 
[Sub-images](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-subimage.html):

{: .procedure }
1. Select the shifted molecule in the 
   [Molecule list](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-sample-management.html#molecule-list) of 
   [Sample management](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-sample-management.html)  
     
1. Select donor excitation in menu **(a)** of 
   [Single molecule images](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-subimage.html#single-molecule-images)  
     
1. Press 
   ![recenter all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-recenter-all.png) in 
   [Single molecule coordinates](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-subimage.html#single-molecule-coordinates)  
     
1. Go back to step 1 until all shifted molecules are recentered

To correct intensities from background light:

{: .procedure }
1. Define 
   [Background correction settings](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-background-correction.html#background-correction-settings) for each trace selected in menu **(a)**:  
     
   <u>default</u>: method `<N median values>`  
   <u>default</u>: parameter **(d)** to 20 pixels  
     
1. Check that option 
   [Apply background correction](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-background-correction.html#apply-background-correction) is activated for each trace selected in menu **(a)** of 
   [Background correction settings](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-background-correction.html#background-correction-settings)  
     
1. Press 
   ![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all") to apply the same settings to all molecules

To correct intensities from cross-talks (if you are working with single detection channel and single laser illumination, ignore this step):

{: .procedure }
1. Set for each emitter selected in the 
    [Emitter list](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-crosstalk-corrections.html#emitter-list):  
	  
   <u>default</u>: [Bleedthrough coefficients](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-crosstalk-corrections.html#bleedthrough-coefficients) set to 0  
   <u>default</u>: [Direct excitation coefficients](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-crosstalk-corrections.html#direct-excitation-coefficients) set to 0

## Sort time traces

Now that molecule positions and intensities are corrected, we can reliably exclude irrelevant intensity-time traces from the project, *e. g* incorrectly labelled species, and sort relevant traces into subgroups.

To remove incorrectly labelled species from the project, the molecule has first to be identified and tagged.
Then, Tagged molecules can be deselected and cleared from the project.

   [Histogram plot](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-automatic-sorting.html#histogram-plot) 
     
1. In panel 
   [Range](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-automatic-sorting.html#range), set parameters:  
     
   <u>defaut</u>: option `at least` in menu **(e)**  
   <u>defaut</u>: parameter **(f)** to 90%  
   <u>defaut</u>: option `percentage of the trace` in menu **(h)**  
     
1. Select the option `total [E] (at [W]nm)` in menu **(a)** of 
   [Concatenated trace plot](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-automatic-sorting.html#concatenated-trace-plot) and verify that selected traces are fluctuating around 0  
     
1. Press 
   ![Save range](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-save-range.png "Save range") in panel 
   [Range](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-automatic-sorting.html#range) to save range settings

   [Tags](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-automatic-sorting.html#tags) and press 
   ![Tag](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tag.png "Tag") to assign this label to the selected range  
     
1. Press 
   ![TAG MOLECULES](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tag-molecules.png "TAG MOLECULES") to tag with `no-[E]` all molecules missing emitter `[E]` 

To clear species missing emitter `[E]` from the project:

{: .procedure }
1. Select tool 
   [Overview](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-overview.html)  
     
1. In 
   [Molecule selection](../../trace-processing/functionalities/tm-overview.html#molecule-selection), select option `remove no-[E]` in menu **(a)** to deselect all molecules carrying this tag

## Discretize time-traces

To obtain reliable state trajectories, photobleached or interrupted data must be ignored and ratio-time traces must be corrected prior applying the state finding algorithm.
This is done by splitting trajectories manually, automatically detecting and truncating the trace at dye photobleaching and setting/calculating global gamma and beta factors.

To split trajectories at intensity interruptions:

{: .procedure }
1. Define in 
   [Photobleaching](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-photobleaching.html):  
     
   <u>default</u>: method `Manual`

   <u>default</u>: data `all intensities`  
   <u>default</u>: parameters in
   [Automatic detection settings](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-photobleaching.html#automatic-detection-settings) **(b)** to 0, **(c)** to 2 frames and **(d)** to 10 frames  
   <u>default</u>: option `Cut` activated  
       
1. Press 
   ![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all") to apply the same settings to all molecules  
     
1. Press 
   ![UPDATE ALL](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-all.png "UPDATE ALL") in 
   [Sample management](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-sample-management.html) to process all molecules in the project and visualize truncated trajectories
   
To automatically calculate gamma and beta factors (if you are working without FRET calculations, ignore this step):

{: .procedure }
1. For each FRET pair listed in the 
   [FRET pair list](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-factor-corrections.html#fret-pair-list) in 
   [Factor corrections](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-factor-corrections.html), define:  
     
   <u>default</u>: method `ES linear regression` (if you are working without stoichiometry calculations, use any other method)   
   <u>default</u>: in 
   [ES linear regression](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-factor-corrections.html#es-linear-regression), **(b)** to `All molecules`, **(c)** to -0.2, **(d)** to 50, **(e)** to 1.2, **(f)** to 1, **(g)** to 50, **(h)** to 3
     
    and press

   ![Save and close](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-save-and-close.png "Save and close") to save settings  
     
1. Press 
   ![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all") to apply the same settings to all molecules  
     
1. Press 
   ![UPDATE ALL](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-all.png "UPDATE ALL") in 
   [Sample management](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-sample-management.html) to process all molecules in the project
   
To obtain state trajectories:

{: .procedure }
1. Define in 
   [Find states](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-find-states.html):  
     
   <u>default</u>: method `STaSI`  
   <u>default</u>: apply to `all`  
   <u>default</u>:
   [Method parameters](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-find-states.html#method-parameters) **(b)** to 5 for each trace selected in menu **(a)**  
   <u>default</u>: no
   [Post-processing methods](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-find-states.html#post-processing-methods) with **(b)** an **(c)** set to 0
       
1. Press 
   ![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all") to apply the same settings to all molecules  
     
1. Press 
   ![UPDATE ALL](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-all.png "UPDATE ALL") in 
   [Sample management](../../trace-processing/panels/panel-sample-management.html) to process all molecules in the project

## Save and export

Project modifications must be saved to the [.mash file](../../output-files/mash-mash-project) in order to perform 
[Step 3](identify-state-network.html) and 
[Step 4](determine-state-populations.html) with processed data.

Beside, various ASCII and image files containing processed data, data statistics and processing parameters can be exported for use in other software.

To save project modifications:

{: .procedure }
1. Press 
   ![Save](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-save.png "Save") and overwrite the current 
   [.mash file]() or create another project file to keep a backup of unprocessed data

To export processed data to ASCII and image files:

{: .procedure }
1. Press 
   ![Export ASCII...](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-export-ascii-3p.png "Export ASCII...") to open and set export options; please refer to 
   [Set export options](../../trace-processing/functionalities/set-export-options.html) for help  
     
1. Press 
   ![Next >>](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-next-supsup.png "Next >>") to start file export

## Merge projects

After applying proper corrections to intensities and sorting out molecules, samples from different projects with identical experiment settings can be merged into one big data set. 
This prevents to repeat the following data analysis procedure on multiple mash files and allows to constitute a more representative sample of molecules.

To merge projects:

{: .procedure }
1. Select the multiple projects to merge in the 
   [Project list](../../trace-processing/panels/area-project-management.html#project-list)  
     
1. Right-click in the 
   [Project list](), choose the option `Merge projects` and press 
   ![Yes](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-yes.png "Yes") to start the merging process  
      
   **Note:** *The merging process induces a loss of single molecule videos that were used in individual projects. 
   Make sure to perform all adjustments of molecule positions and background corrections prior merging.
