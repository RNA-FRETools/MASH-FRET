# Visualization area
{: .no_toc }

The visualization area is the main display of module Trace processing.

Use this area to visualize processed and calculated data.

## Single molecule images

Single molecule images show a close-up of the current single molecule position in each detection channel.
Average image at specific laser illumination are used.
Laser illumination and image appearance can be adjusted in panel 
[Sub-images](panel-subimage.html).

Single molecule positions are indicated by crosses and framed by squares of dimensions used for intensity integration; see 
[Integration parameters](../../video-processing/panels/panel-intensity-integration.html#integration-parameters) for more information.

The position of the current molecule selected in the 
[Molecule list](panel-sample-management.html#molecule-list) is displayed in red, whereas other molecules are displayed in yellow.
When using the `Dark trace` background correction method, dark coordinates are shown in green; see 
[Background correction settings](panel-background-correction.html#background-correction-settings) for more information.

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.

## Intensity-time traces and histograms

Trace axes show the current single molecule intensity-time traces selected in 
[Plot in top axes](panel-plot.html#plot-in-top-axes), using intensity and time units defined in 
[Intensity units](panel-plot.html#intensity-units) and 
[Time axis](panel-plot.html#time-axis) respectively.

The time axis can be truncated by setting the starting point in 
[Time axis](panel-plot.html#time-axis) and the ending point in 
[Photobleaching cutoff](panel-photobleaching.html#photobleaching-cutoff).

Histogram axes show the corresponding intensity histograms built by sorting intensities in 100 bins between the minimum and maximum intensities.

![Top time traces of a deselected molecule](../../assets/images/gui/TP-area-visu-toptraces-deselected.png "deselected molecule")

Colors used in trace and histogram plots are defined in the project options; see 
[Edit project options](area-project-management.html#edit-project-options) for more information.

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.

## Ratio-time traces and histograms

Trace axes show the current single molecule FRET- and stoichiometry-time traces selected in 
[Plot in bottom axes](panel-plot.html#plot-in-bottom-axes), using time units defined in 
[Time axis](panel-plot.html#time-axis).

The time axis can be truncated by setting the starting point in 
[Time axis](panel-plot.html#time-axis) and the ending point in 
[Photobleaching cutoff](panel-photobleaching.html#photobleaching-cutoff).

Histogram axes show the corresponding histograms built by sorting FRET and stoichiometry values into bins of size 0.01 between -0.2 and 1.2.

![Bottom time traces of a deselected molecule](../../assets/images/gui/TP-area-visu-bottomtraces-deselected.png "deselected molecule")

FRET and stoichiometry calculations, as well as colors used in trace and histogram plots, are defined in the project options; see 
[Edit project options](area-project-management.html#edit-project-options) for more information.

Any graphics in MASH can be exported to an image file by right-clicking on the axes and selecting `Export graph`.
