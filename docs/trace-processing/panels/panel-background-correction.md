Background estimation methods are configured for individual intensity-time traces that can be selected in menu **(a)**.

MASH includes six background estimation methods that can be selected in menu **(b)**.
To configure a method, set parameters **(c - g)** according to the detailed description given in the table below.

For method `Dark trace`, the dark pixel coordinates are shown by a green cross mark on the corresponding 
[Sub-images](area-visualization.html#single-molecule-images).

The smoothed background intensity-time trace can be shown by pressing 
![Show](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-show.png "Show"). 
In this case, an additional window appears with the dark trace plot in intensity units defined by 
[Intensity units](panel-plot.html#intensity-units).

![Dark trace](../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-bg-darktrace.png "Dark trace")

After method configuration, the same settings can be applied to all molecules by pressing 
![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all"); see 
[Apply settings to all molecules](#apply-settings-to-all-molecules).

## Background analyzer

Press 
![Opt.](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-optp.png "Opt.") to open Background analyzer.

Background analyzer is used to to screen parameter settings for background estimation.

To use Background analyzer, please refer to 
[Use Background analyzer](../functionalities/use-background-analyzer.html).

## Background intensity

Displays the background intensity estimated by the method  and for the intensity-time trace selected in 
[Background correction settings](#background-correction-settings).

For method `Manual`, the background intensity to subtract must be set here.

As the method `Dark tarce` calculates a background trajectory and not an intensity, the mean value of the dark trace is displayed here.

The background intensity is given in image counts per pixel and/or per second according to intensity units defined in 
[Intensity units](panel-plot.html#intensity-units).

## Apply background correction

Activate this option to subtract the background from the intensity-time trace selected in 
[Background correction settings](#background-correction-settings), or deactivate this option to visualize the original intensity-time trace.

For more information about how background correction is performed, see 
[Background correction](../workflow.html#background-correction) in Trace processing workflow.

## Apply settings to all molecules

Press 
![all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-all.png "all") to apply trace-specific 
[Background correction settings](#background-correction-settings) to all molecules.

Corrections are applied to other molecules only when the corresponding data is processed, *e. g.* when pressing 
![UPDATE ALL](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-all.png "UPDATE ALL"); see 
[Process all molecules data](panel-sample-management.html#process-all-molecules-data) for more information.
