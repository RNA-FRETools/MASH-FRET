## Denoising settings

Use this interface to define a denoising method.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-denoise-param.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-denoise-param.png" style="max-width: 273px;"/></a>

Denoising applies to intensity-time traces. 
Intensity ratio-time traces are recalculated from smoothed intensity trajectories.

Three denoising methods are available and are described in the following sections:

* [Sliding average](#sliding-average)
* [NL filter (Haran)](#nl-filter-haran)
* [Wavelet (Taylor)](#wavelet-taylor)

Select the denoising method in menu **(a)** and set the corresponding parameters in **(b-d)**.
Method parametrizations are described in details in the table below.

| method                                         | parametrization                                                                                                                                                                     | default parameters              |

The MATLAB scripts for method `NL fitler (Haran)` was generously provided by Dr Stefan Krause from the Institute of Physics, Chemnitz University of Technology.

The MATLAB scripts for method `Wavelet (Taylor)` was downloaded from 
[LandesLab](https://github.com/LandesLab/Wavelet-Denoise) Github repository.


### Sliding average
{: .no_toc }

Each intensity data point is recalculated as the average value over a frame window composed of **(b)** frames and centered on the data point.


### NL filter (Haran)
{: .no_toc }

This algorithm performs the non-linear filtering procedure of Chung and Kennedy on donor and acceptor time traces. 
It smooths intensity-time traces of a FRET pair and emphasizes synchronized jumps in donor and acceptor intensity-time traces that are considered as FRET transitions.

In a first place, the causal and anti-causal means,
[*I*&#713;<sub>*t*-*r*</sub>(*t*)](){: .math_var } and 
[*I*&#713;<sub>*t*+*r*</sub>(*t*)](){: .math_var } respectively, are calculated for each data point 
[*t*](){: .math_var } of the intensity-time trace 
[*I*(*t*)](){: .math_var } such as:

{: .equation} 
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-01.gif" alt=""><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-02.gif" alt="">

and  over four different frame ranges 
[*r*](){: .math_var }, such as:

{: .equation }
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-03.gif" alt="">

with 
[P<sub>1</sub>](){: .math_var } the parameter set in **(b)**.

Then, for each data point 
[*t*](){: .math_var } is assigned a causal and an anti-causal weight, 
[*w*<sub>*t*-*r*</sub>(*t*)](){: .math_var } and 
[*w*<sub>*t*+*r*</sub>(*t*)](){: .math_var } 
respectively, that are inversely related to the corresponding variances, 
[*&#963;*<sub>*t*-*r*</sub><sup>2</sup>(*t*)](){: .math_var } and 
[*&#963;*<sub>*t*+*r*</sub><sup>2</sup>(*t*)](){: .math_var }, such as:

{: .equation} 
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-06.gif" alt=""><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-07.gif" alt="">

with 
[P<sub>3</sub>](){: .math_var } the parameter set in **(d)**, which emphasizes the differences between low- and high-weight data.

Causal and anti-causal variances represents the gap between the means and the experimental intensity: the higher the gap, the most probable a transition. 
Variances are calculated over a fixed frame range 
[*P<sub>2</sub>*](){: .math_var } such as:

{: .equation} 
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-04.gif" alt=""><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-05.gif" alt="">

with 
[P<sub>2</sub>](){: .math_var } the parameter set in **(c)** that represent the delay necessary for a transition to fully start and end.

Finally, smoothed intensities 
[*I*<sub>denoise</sub>(*t*)](){: .math_var } are calculated as the weighted sum of the causal and anti-causal mean intensities over all 
[*r*](){: .math_var } ranges, and normalized by the sum of donor and acceptor causal and anti-causal weights.
For instance, smoothed acceptor intensity is calculated such as:

{: .equation} 
<img src="../../assets/images/equations/TP-eq-denoise-08.gif" alt=""><br>


### Wavelet (Taylor)
{: .no_toc }

The script first runs the Haar-wavelet decomposition on intensity-time traces and on several levels.
Thresholding is then performed on Haar coefficient according to three different strengths:
* firm thresholding: **(b)** = 1
* hard thresholding: **(b)** = 2
* soft thresholding: **(b)** = 3

Thresholds can either be calculated for each decomposition level by setting **(c)** = 1, or set constant by setting **(c)** = 2.
Denoised intensity-time traces are obtained by inversion of the wavelet transformation.

Denoising can either be performed in one simple process by setting **(d)** = 1, or by several iterative processes including time-shifting by setting **(d)** = 2. 
In the latter case, the final trace is averaged over the different process iterations.

**Note:** *The use of hard thresholding can be relatively time consuming and requires a bit of patience.*

## Apply denoising

Activate or deactivate this option to smooth or visualize the original intensity-time trace respectively.

For more information about the use of denoising in smFRET data analysis, see 
[Smooth trajectories](../workflow.html#smooth-trajectories) in Trace processing workflow.
