# Trace processing

Trace processing is the third module of MASH-FRET and is accessed by pressing 
![Trace processing](assets/images/gui/TP-but-trace-processing.png "Trace processing") in the main 
[tool bar](Getting_started.html#interface).

Use this module to sort single molecules and obtain state trajectories from intensity-time traces. 
Trace processing recieves as input 
[Simulation](simulation.html)'s output trajectories, 
[Video processing](video-processing.html)'s output trajectories, or trajectories read from ASCII files. 
See 
[Create a new project](Getting_started.html#create-a-new-project) to get started. 

Learn about the main trace processing procedure in the 
[Workflow](trace-processing/workflow.html) section, special functionalities in 
[Functionalities](trace-processing/functionalities.html) and individual interface components in 
[Components](trace-processing/components.html).
