# Use Trace manager
{: .no_toc }

The trace manager gives an overview of all single molecules in the project and allows to assemble a molecule selection as well as to give molecules specific tags.

It is accessed by pressing 
![TM](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tm.png "TM") in the 
[Sample management](../panels/panel-sample-management.html#trace-manager) panel of module Trace processing.

Trace manager is used to sort molecules into sub-groups and/or exclude irrelevant traces from the set.
It is composed of three modules:


---

{% include tm_head.html %}

Overview is used to browse individual molecules and assemble a molecule selection.
The final molecule selection is exported to module Trace processing by pressing 
![TO MASH](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-to-mash.png "TO MASH").

Overview is divided into two panels **(1-2)**.

## Overall plots

Use this interface to identify outliers in the molecule selection by controlling irregularities in data distributions.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-overallplot.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-overallplot.png"/></a>

Overall plots show the following cumulated data plots for the molecule selection assembled in panel 
[Molecule selection](#molecule-selection):
- [Concatenated traces](#concatenated-traces) shown in axes **(c)**
- [Histograms](#histograms) shown in axes **(d)**

Data plots must be updated after modification of the molecule selection by pressing 
![UPDATE](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-tm.png "UPDATE").

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-loadingbar.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-loadingbar.png" style="max-width:389px;"/></a>

The final molecule selection is exported to module Trace processing by pressing 
![TO MASH](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-to-mash.png "TO MASH"); as the operation can not be reversed, a warning pops up.

### Concatenated traces
{: .no_toc }

Concatenated time traces of selected molecules allow to identify outliers.

For instance, intensity-time traces with abnormally high or low intensities are easily visible and are good candidates for exclusion from the set.

Data available for concatenated trace plot are listed in menu **(a)** and include:
* `[E] at [W]nm` for intensity-time traces, with `[E]` the emitter and `[W]` the laser wavelength
* `total [E] (at [W]nm)` for intensity-time traces of emitter `[E]` in absence of any acceptor and upon emitter-specific excitation wavelength `[W]`
* `FRET [D]>[A]` for FRET-time traces, with `[D]` and `[A]` the donor and acceptor emitters respectively
* `S [D]>[A]` for stoichiometry data  associated to the FRET pair where `[D]` and `[A]` are the donor and acceptor emitters respectively

Selected molecules that are in view in panel
[Molecule selection](#molecule-selection) are highlighted with a white background, whereas excluded or out-of-view molecules are covered with a transparent black mask.

Individual molecules can be accessed and shown in 
[Molecule selection](#molecule-selection) by simply clicking on the corresponding portion of the concatenated time trace.


### Histograms
{: .no_toc }

Overall 1D- or 2D-data histograms are used to identify different sub-populations in the sample and to control the homogeneity of data distribution.

For instance, the presence of single labelled species is easily identified by peaks centered on 0 and 1 in the overall stoichiometry histogram and indicates the need for further sample refinement.

For 1D histogram plot, menu **(c)** must be set to `none` and menu **(b)** to one of the following data to histogram:
* `[E] at [W]nm` for intensity histograms
* `total [E] (at [W]nm)` for intensity histograms in absence of any acceptor
* `FRET [D]>[A]` for FRET histograms
* `S [D]>[A]` for stoichiometry data  associated to the FRET pair where `[D]` and `[A]` are the donor and acceptor emitters respectively

For 2D histogram plot, menu **(b)** and **(c)** must be set to data to plot in the x- and y-dimension respectively.

Data are sorted into bins defined in columns **(h)** (lowest limit), **(i)** (number of binning intervals) and **(j)** (highest limit) and in row **(f)** or **(g)** for the x- or y-axis respectively,.

2D histograms are built with the MATLAB script `hist2` developed by Tudor Dima that can be found in the 
[MATLAB exchange platform](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18386-2d-histogram-exact-and-fast-binning-crop-and-stretch-grid-adjustment?s_tid=prof_contriblnk).

## Molecule selection

Use this interface to assemble or review the molecule selection.

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-moleculeselection.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-moleculeselection.png"/></a>

Panel Molecule selection shows individual data plots defined by 
[Plot](../panels/panel-plot.html) for individual molecules that can be browsed using the sliding bar in **(m)**. 

The interface can be optimized by adjusting the number of molecules per page in **(f)**, and hiding the panel 
[Overall plot](#overall-plot) by pressing 
![\^](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-triangle.png "^").

Intensity-time traces and histograms are respectively shown in axes **(j)** and **(k)**, whereas FRET- and stoichiometry-time traces and histograms are respectively shown in axes **(k)** and **(l)**. 

Individual single molecule data are inspected one by one to define their status, which includes:
* [Sample exclusion](#sample-exclusion) 
* [Subgroup affiliation](#subgroup-affiliation)

For instance, single molecules with incoherent intensity-time traces can be excluded from the selection and static FRET traces can be affiliated to the `static` subgroup. 

[Overall plots](#overall-plots) must be updated after finishing modifications in 
[Sample exclusion](#sample-exclusion) by pressing 
![UPDATE](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-update-tm.png "UPDATE").

<a class="plain" href="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-loadingbar.png"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-loadingbar.png" style="max-width:389px;"/></a>


### Sample exclusion
{: .no_toc }

Selection or exclusion of individual molecules is done by activating/deactivating the option in **(e)**.

To help with sample selection, groups of molecules can be selected/unselected at the same time using the list of criteria in menu **(a)**.
Selection criteria are:
- `current`: uses the current selection (default)
- `all`: selects all molecules
- `none`: exclude all molecules
- `inverse`: select excluded molecules and exclude selected molecules in the current selection
- `add [Tag]`: add molecules affiliated to subgroup selected in menu **(b)** to the current selection
- `add not [Tag]`: add molecules that are not affiliated to subgroup selected in menu **(b)** to the current selection
- `remove [Tag]`: remove molecules affiliated to subgroup selected in menu **(b)** from the current selection
- `remove not [Tag]`: remove molecules that are not affiliated to subgroup selected in menu **(b)** from the current selection

Press 
![Apply](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-apply.png "Apply") to refine the molecule selection according to these settings.


### Subgroup affiliation
{: .no_toc }

Subgroup affiliations (tags) are listed in **(e)**.

<u>Create a new tag</u> by typing the new tag name in **(d)**, and pressing 
![Set color](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-set-color.png "Set color") to modify the associated color (can be modified any time).

<u>Delete a tag</u> by selecting the tag in menu **(e)** and pressing 
![Delete tag](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-delete-tag.png "Delete tag"); as the operation can not be reversed, a confirmation warning pops up if some molecules are affiliated to the corresponding subgroup.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-moleculeselection-warn2.png" style="max-width:489px;">

Tags of individual molecules are listed in **(h)**.

<u>Tag individual molecules</u> by selecting a tag in menu **(i)** and pressing 
![Tag](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tag.png "Tag").

<u>Remove tag from individual molecules</u> by selecting a tag in menu **(i)** and pressing 
![Untag](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-untag.png "Untag").

<u>Remove tag from all molecules</u> at once by pressing 
![Untag all](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-untag-all.png "Untag all").
In this case, all molecule tag listed in **(h)** will be irreversibly cleared.
As the operation can not be reversed, a confirmation warning pops up.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-moleculeselection-warn1.png" style="max-width:409px;">

<u>Tag molecules included in selection</u> all at the same time by selecting the desired tag in menu **(c)** and pressing 
![Tag selection](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tag-selection.png "Tag selection").
As the operation can not be reversed, a confirmation warning pops up.

<img src="../../assets/images/gui/TP-panel-sample-tm-overview-moleculeselection-warn3.png" style="max-width:402px;">

<u>Perform more advanced molecule tagging</u> by defining groups of molecules using specific data criteria with the tool 
[Automatic sorting](tm-automatic-sorting.html).
To identify molecule subgroups in the video, molecule tags can be visualized on the average video image with tool  with the tool 
[Video view](tm-video-view.html).
